Throughout my academic journey, I gained a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and software development. The curriculum covered core subjects such as programming in C, C++, Java, and Python, data structures, database management systems (DBMS), operating systems, web development, and computer networks. In addition to programming, I also explored areas like software engineering principles, data analytics, mathematics for computing, and information security, which helped build problem-solving and logical reasoning skills. Practical lab sessions, mini-projects, and case studies allowed me to apply my learning to real-world scenarios, preparing me for technical roles in data analysis, web development, and software development.",
